Unimod priming experiment data preprocessing and analysis, pilot version

Background:
This experiment serves as a continuation of earlier investigations highlighted in the References. The earlier findings indicated that listeners exhibit the quickest reaction times when the prime syllable's phoneme matches the target word's first phoneme. Additionally, it showed that a shorter reaction time in recognizing the target word occurs when the stress on the prime syllable aligns with the initial syllable of the target word's stress. Previous studies addressed this phenomenon in non-fixed stress languages, such as German; however, this experiment focuses on the context of a fixed-stressed language, such as Hungarian, where the stress is always on the first syllable. /The full experiment also incorporates an ERP measurement./

Methods:
Participants (N=6) listened to a syllable (prime), which was shortly followed by a two-syllable word (target) or a pseudoword. The primes were spoken by a male, and the targets were spoken by a female speaker. We implemented it in a GO/NoGo paradigm: participants were asked to decide whether the target word was a real Hungarian word and had to press a button on a response box as soon as possible. In the case of pseudowords particiants were instructed to refrain from pressing any buttons.

Primes could either be stressed or unstressed and the target words' first syllables could either match with the prime in stress and/or phoneme, thus resulting in four different conditions:

1. stress match, phoneme match, e.g. MON- MONster 
2. stress match, phoneme mismatch, e.g. MON- DACkel 
3. stress mismatch, phoneme match, e.g. mon- MONster 
4. stress mismatch, phoneme mismatch, e.g. mon- DACkel

Hypotheses:
H01:
There is no difference between reaction times in phoneme overlap.
HA1:
Reaction times are smaller when the prime and target overlap in phoneme.

H02:
There is no difference between reaction times in stress overlap.
HA2:
Reaction times are smaller when the prime and target overlap in stress.

Results:
We observed a decresead reaction time for the phoneme overlap condition, but didn't find difference in the stress overlap condition. The later result is likely due to the limited sample size of the pilot study.
